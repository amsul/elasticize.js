# elasticize.js

A tiny (1kb) jQuery plugin to dynamically resize the height of a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> field as you type.

<code>border-width</code> has to be 0 to work right. You can create a fake border with <code>box-shadow</code> like in the <a href="http://amsul.github.com/elasticize.js/">demo</a>.

Works with all major browsers: Chrome, Firefox 3.5+, Safari, IE 9+, Opera 10.5+, iOS 3.2+, Android browser 2.1+

# elasticize.js

A tiny (1kb) jQuery plugin to dynamically resize the height of a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> field as you type.

<code>border-width</code> has to be 0 to work right. You can create a fake border with <code>box-shadow</code> like in the demo to the left.

Works best with latest browsers.. *probably not for everyone*
